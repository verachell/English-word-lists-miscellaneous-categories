# English-word-lists-miscellaneous-categories
A categorized collection of English word lists, created manually

I put these word lists together myself manually. They are not exhaustive lists of every possible thing in each category. In each category, I thought of as many words as I could and wrote them down. Then I asked relatives and friends for suggestions of additional words and added these in. In some cases (e.g. colors, trees) I then researched on the internet from a variety of sources; when I found an item that wasn't already on the list I added it in.
